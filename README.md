# Hi, I’m Ntokozo (RTT-DEV)👋

I’m a **software developer** with a strong foundation in Mathematics, Computer Science and a huge interest in **computer graphics programming, and low-level systems**.  
I enjoy understanding how things work under the hood and building projects that focus on performance and modularity.
