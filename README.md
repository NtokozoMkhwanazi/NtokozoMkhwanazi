# Hi, I’m Ntokozo 👋

I’m a **software developer** with a strong foundation in Mathematics, Computer Science and a huge interest in **game and simulation engine development,computer graphics programming, and low-level systems**.  
I enjoy understanding how things work under the hood and building projects that focus on performance, structure, and clarity.

---

## 🧠 What I’m focused on
- Game and Simulation engine development
- Graphics programming (OpenGL and in the future vulkan)
- Algorithms & problem solving
- Writing clean, efficient, low-level code

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** C/C++, GLSL
- **Graphics & Media:** OpenGL, SFML
- **Libraries:** GLAD, GLFW, stb_image, ASSIMP
- **Concepts:** OOP, Data Structures, Algorithms, Game and Simulation Engine Architecture
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Linux

---

## 🚀 Projects
- ⚙️ **RTT-Engine** – Custom 3D engine focusing on OpenGL rendering and engine architecture  
- 🎮 **SFML Tic Tac Toe** – Game with AI logic and graphics  
- 🧩 **8-Puzzle Solver** – Algorithm-based puzzle solver
- ⚙️ **2D-RTT-ENGINE** - Custom 2D game engine focusing on SFML rendering and game engine architecture

(See pinned repositories below 👇)

---

## 📈 What I’m working toward
- Deeper understanding of graphics pipelines
- Stronger architecture and tooling for the RTT-engine (3D Game and Simulation engine) 
- Above all the aim is to have fun, by creating cool and great projects
