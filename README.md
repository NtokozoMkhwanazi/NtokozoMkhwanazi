## 🧠 What I’m focused on
- Game engine development
- Graphics programming (OpenGL)
- Algorithms & problem solving
- Writing clean, efficient, low-level code

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** C/C++
- **Graphics & Media:** OpenGL, SFML
- **Libraries:** GLAD, GLFW, stb_image, ASSIMP
- **Concepts:** OOP, Data Structures, Algorithms, Game Engine Architecture
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Linux
